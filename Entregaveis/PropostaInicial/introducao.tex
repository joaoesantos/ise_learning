Nowadays there are some platforms that provide an environment for defining algorithms and testing, but not all of them are open source, don't have such an appealing environment or they don't allow multi-language.
\\
Therefore, this project intends to develop an open source e-learning platform, dedicated to the definition and testing of algorithms in a multi-language environment.
\\
This platform will have several challenges which can be solved for study or evaluation purposes. This can be useful in academic environments, professional interviews or programming enthusiast.\nocite{ref2}
