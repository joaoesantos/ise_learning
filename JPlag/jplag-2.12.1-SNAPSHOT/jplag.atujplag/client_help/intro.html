<h2>What is JPlag</h2>
<p>JPlag is a system that finds similarities among multiple sets of
source code files. This way it can detect software plagiarism. JPlag
does not merely compare bytes of text, but is aware of programming
language syntax and program structure and hence is robust against many
kinds of attempts to disguise similarities between plagiarized files.
JPlag currently supports Java, C#, C, C++, Scheme, and natural language
text. <br>
JPlag is typically used to detect and thus discourage the unallowed
copying of student exercise programs in programming education. But in
principle it can also be used to detect stolen software parts among
large amounts of source text or modules that have been duplicated (and
only slightly modified). JPlag has already played a part in several
intellectual property cases where it has been successfully used by
expert witnesses. <br>
JPlag has a powerful graphical interface for presenting its results.

<h2><a name="account"/> Getting a Jplag account</a></h2>
The use of JPlag is free, but you must
obtain an account. This requirement is not only necessary to avoid
unauthorized use of JPlag by students, but also to provide the easy and
installation-free access to the software. <br>
For obtaining a </a><a href="user.cgi">JPlag account</a>, please
contact the authors by e-mail at <a href="mailto:jplag@ira.uka.de">JPlag@ira.uka.de</a>
and shortly describe the purpose for which you want to use JPlag (which
university/school and course etc.). Please note that we do not give
accounts to users of anonymous email address like Hotmail, Yahoo,
Gmail, etc. <br>
Just to make it clear: Currently JPlag does not compare to the
internet! It is designed to find similarities among the student
solutions, which is usually sufficient for computer programs.

<h3>Setting JPlag home directory.</h3>
Your JPlag home directory is the
default directory where your JPlag results are stored ,and is used by
JPlag Client to store temporar files.
<a name="country_lang"> </a>
<h3>Setting country language.</h3>
JPlag is a international oriented
application, and the JPlag results are available in many languages. We
are also trying to make this JPlag client available in as many language
as possible. Maybe you help us doing it. The currently supported
country languages are Englisch, French , German and
Portuguese .
