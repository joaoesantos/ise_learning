<h2><a name="chapter1"> How to submit files to JPlag?</a></h2>
In this section you will learn about all options of the JPlag . You will also learn how 
this powerfull JPlag Client analyses&nbsp; your options and detects errors, 
preventing you to send bad submissions to&nbsp; JPlag. We assume that you have 
successfully <a href="main.html#kapitel2_account">installed and started this JPlag client.</a>. 
<h3>Description of JPlag general options.</h3>
The JPlag general options are the common and most used options and are required. Some advanced options could also be 
required,&nbsp; but this JPlag client will set those options to the default values. 
 <a name="chapter1_title"/>
<h4>Submission title selection.</h4>
The submission title is the name of your submission. Here, submission means the set of files and directories that will be send to the Jplag server 
to be compared to each oders .Each element of this set of files is also named 
submision. In this way, a JPlag submission is a set of directories and files 
also named submissions that can be compared to each oders.<br>A submission 
title should not have any space betwenn characters.It will be used by JPlag client as the name of the result directory.
In this way if your submission title is "assignment1" , the JPlag result will be stored in /PATH/TO 
REPORT&nbsp; LOCATION /assignment1/  
 <a name="chapter1_Submission_directory"/>  
<h4>Submission directory selection.</h4> 
<a name="chapter1_Submission_directory"/>The submission directory is the lowest level directory containing 
all files that will be submitted. In the example in <a href="main.html#fig1.1">"figure 1.1</a> , if you want to compare the programs of the students
student1, student2, student3, student4 and student5 wich are respectively located in directories with the same name,
you must select the directory Student_prog as submission directory. Setting 
aDocument as root directory would lead JPlag to compare the documents: 
Student_prog , document1 and documentn.<p>

 <a name="chapter1_language"/>
<h4>Language (programming language) selection.</h4> 
One of the most important options. Selecting a bad or unsuitable language lead JPlag to not or unsuccessfully
parses files from submissions. Especially for the programming language Java(TM),using of java15 is advisable because
some students can use java 1.4 syntax while anothers use java 5.0 syntax.<br>
When selecting a language, corresponding default options for this language are automatically setted.  
 <a name="chapter1_report_directory"/>
<h4>Report directory selection.</h4>
The directory containing JPlag results will be stored in the report directory. 
 <a name="chapter1_recurse"/> 
<h4>Usage of option: recurse into directories.</h4> 
This option allow JPlag to recurse into all directories or (students) submissions. 
For the example below, if the option recurse into directories is set to false, 
then the package myPackage of the submission student1_programs will not be taken 
in account.
