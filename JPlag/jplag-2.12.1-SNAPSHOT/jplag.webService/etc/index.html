<center>Welcome to our JPlag web service!</center><br><br>
This is just a totally basic web page to make it easier to access the Web Start client:<br><br>
<center><a href="jplagClient.jnlp">Sample Web Start client for JPlag web service</a></center>
<br><br>
There's a big load of libraries, which will be downloaded together with the client
(7.3 MB). I only uploaded a minimum set of libraries, but perhaps there are
smaller ones available for this perpose.<br>
The client will ask for full access to your computer, as the original version did,
because it zips up a directory (I didn't check whether there are better security
settings for that than there were when the original version was developed...).<br>
If you submit files, the client seems to hang, because the zipping, sending and
waiting for a response are stupidly executed in Swing's interaction thread. This
will be subject of change ;)<br>
Also there may be problems when sending bigger submissions, when the SOAP messages
become too big. This hasn't been correctly tested yet!<br><br>
But we still hope, that you can enjoy playing around with this application ;D<br><br>
PS: The "Advanced options" button is a fake currently...
